One data normalization problem is keeping your data two-dimensional, in other words, figuring out when and how to split up your data into separate tables. For instance, when keeping track of customer data, purchase data is better kept separate from data such as mailing address, password, and credit card information. Since different customers will have different numbers of purchases, trying to keep track of purchases as columns in the same table as the mailing and credit card info might lead to empty and irregular cells, as well as having repetitive column names. The better rule of thumb is to separate out the tasks of maintaining contact information and purchase histories into two different tables, and then linking or relating them together by customer name.
